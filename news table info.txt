1 article each by authors # 3 and # 4



Q1: Most popular articles.....select articles.title, count(log.path) from log join articles on log.path = articles.slug group by articles.title order by count(path) desc limit 3;

- hint: just join the log.path with articles.slug and use concat() to add /article/ to the slug

	- used: update articles set slug = concat('/article/', slug);

Q2: Most popular authors.....select authors.name, articles.title from authors join articles on authors.id = articles.author join log on log.path = articles.slug group by authors.name, articles.title order by count(path) desc limit 3;

Q3: On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors

	- select date(time) as day, count(*) as requests, (select count(status) as errors from log where status != '200 OK') from log group by day order by errors desc;  <-- very close, but need to figure out how to get my errors to work with the "order by day" piece and then get the percentage

- 12908 total errors
